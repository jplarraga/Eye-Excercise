<h2> Description </h2>
  
<p> This project uses thhe DOM as a way to access to HTML through the use of javascript and manipulate the elements in order to give it an interacction wit the user interface. The elements are created on HTML then they are styled using CSS and finally the behaviour of the eye in direct relation with the mouse movement is made with Javascript</p>

<h2> Instalation </h2>

<ul>
  <li> The code is free to download from this repository</li>
  <li> All the files have been linked to the index file for proper functioning</li>
  <li> If you are using VS Code I would recomend you download the LiveServer extention in order to watch the changes from the code live</li>
  <li> Is better to follow the behaviour of each component of the code by using Google Chrome Browser on the Inspection tools</li>
</ul>

<h2> Usage </h2>

<p> The usage is directly related to the DOM which is a very important concept in order to understand the behavioral applications of Javascript in a site. The purpose of the excersise is related to animation but the applications of the DOM involve many proposals to make a website more dynamic.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p> The project is limited to the relation of the mouse movement, however there is plenty of room to create more applications for the DOM related to the scroll, the navigation, the appearance and even the execution of a certain task only by using the DOM. Furthermore, we can also implement various other elemenst such as buttons, lists, accordions, sliders, etc.<p>
